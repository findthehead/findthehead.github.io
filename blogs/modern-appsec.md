# Modern Appsec

> ## Modern appsec mainly after the AI realm

We as IT people have seen many technologies before some were felt groundbreaking eventually less used by enterprises  , some felt normal but broke the entire architecture, revolutionized technical landscape like docker, kubernetes. Unlike docker, AI is not a technology that can be used as a wizard but a smart thinking engine.

Application Security also get colourized by its flare. The older approach will no longer be applied on modern system this we need to think it as more productive than before.

> ## Productive Security Operation

Why modern workflow should be productive?
Was not productive before ?

Here the term productive used to compliment the dynamic application Security which is not only be a boring task but also it may get you an instant results.

Modern appsec evolved from older repeated approach to a planned team based multi-ops on the project in question.

Again another jargon, what does that mean by multi-ops?

Multiops involves multi layer security collaboration among the team. A multi-ops team consists of below member
- A senior hobbyist, in this case an architect of the product.
- A fellow accountant, in this case a platform engineer.
- An artist, in this case a principal software engineer.
- A banker, in this case a Senior Security Engineer 


These are the 4 pillars of multi-ops collaboration.

This is an initial step before you start the overall planning of appsec.
